    <h1> About Me </h1>

    <p>My name is Preeti Shenoy, I am a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in User Experience and Interaction Design. After realizing that I wanted to do something in the arts and psychology field, I stumbled upon UI/UX design, and went down the rabbit hole from there. I started my design career in 2018, and have taken multiple steps forward to accomplish my goal of becoming a UX designer.

    When I am not designing something new, I like to paint, listen to music, play video games, and bike. I believe that your profession should be something that you enjoy, and I do believe that mmy hobbies helped influence my career choice. The passion I have for design comes from these hobbies. My love for art helped me appreciate the design side of UX, and my appreciation for psychology led me to understand human-computer interactions better. 

    My plan as a student is to learn as much as I can about the field of UX and broaden my perspective on many other fields of study as well. At drexel, I have access to the co-op program which alllows me to learn more about this field and more with hands-on experience. I plan to utilize this experience to improve as a designer and learn more about the tech industry. 

    As a UXID student, I hope to become a designer that can both deliver beautiful design and functionality. Good design is rooted in usability. My goal is to make designs that can encompass both of those qualities and provide a good experience to the user. I believe that UX is always changing, therefore I aim to adapt to this ever-changing field.
